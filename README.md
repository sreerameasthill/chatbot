# chatbot
AI-powered supply chain chatbot that converts natural language queries into SQL database operations. Built with Python, pandas, and SQLite to manage inventory, track orders, and analyze supplier performance.
Overview
The AI Supply Chain Assistant is an intelligent chatbot designed to streamline supply chain management operations through conversational interfaces. Instead of writing complex SQL queries or navigating multiple dashboards, users can simply ask questions in plain English and receive instant data-driven insights.
Problem Statement
Traditional supply chain management systems often require:

Technical SQL knowledge to query databases
Multiple clicks through complex interfaces
Time-consuming manual data analysis
Separate tools for inventory, orders, and supplier management

Solution
This chatbot provides a unified, conversational interface that:

Understands natural language queries
Automatically generates and executes SQL queries
Provides instant access to critical supply chain data
Requires zero technical knowledge from end users
